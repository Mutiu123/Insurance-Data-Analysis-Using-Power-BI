# Power BI Insurance Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a **Power BI dashboard** for **Altimate Insurance Ltd.** to analyze and visualize key metrics related to insurance policies, claims, and customer data. The dashboard provides insights into premium collections, claim distributions, policy types, and customer demographics, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Tasks and Features

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Connected to **SQL Server** to load insurance data directly into Power BI.
- Extracted data from multiple tables, including policy details, claim records, and customer information.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

### 2. Data Modeling
- Established relationships between tables (e.g., policies, claims, and customers) to enable comprehensive analysis.
- Created calculated columns and measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to derive key metrics.

### 3. Dashboard Development
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with the following features:
  - **Policy Overview**: Analysis of all policies, including active and inactive statuses.
  - **Claim Analysis**: Breakdown of claims by status (e.g., settled, pending) and policy type.
  - **Premium Analysis**: Visualization of premium amounts collected by different policy types (e.g., travel, health, auto, life, home).
  - **Customer Demographics**: Analysis of claims and policies by age groups (e.g., young adults, adults, elderly).

### 4. Visualizations
- Created various visualizations, including:
  - **Bar charts** and **pie charts** for policy and claim distributions.
  - **Tables** for detailed breakdowns of claims by policy type and status.
  - **Filters** to allow users to drill down into specific segments (e.g., by policy type or age group).

### 5. Insights and Reporting
- Provided actionable insights into:
  - The distribution of policies and claims across different categories.
  - Trends in premium collections and claim payouts.
  - The proportion of active vs. inactive policies.
- Enabled stakeholders to monitor financial performance and identify areas for improvement.
